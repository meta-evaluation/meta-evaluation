Here is my explanation: The story presented is not coherent or fluent, as it contains several placeholders marked by \"[FEMALE]\" that have not been filled in with appropriate names or pronouns, which disrupts the flow and makes comprehension difficult. There are also inconsistencies and a lack of clarity in the plot. The narrative jumps from a character apparently being out of school, to being in an office, to being a puppy, and then to an abrupt and unrelated statement about pregnancy.
