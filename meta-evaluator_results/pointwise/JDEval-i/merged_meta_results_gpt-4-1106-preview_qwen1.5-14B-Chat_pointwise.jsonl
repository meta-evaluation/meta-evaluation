Here is my explanation: The story is quite brief and lacks detail, making it difficult to fully immerse the reader in the narrative. It presents a simple idea: a character seeks a second job, goes to a rally, and consistently overpays. However, there's no clear reason for attending the rally or any development in the plot. The coherence is present, but the story feels somewhat平淡 and unoriginal due to its brevity and lack of creative twists or engaging dialogue.\n\nAdditionally, the repetition of \"he kept paying more than he was\" doesn't offer much insight or progression, leaving room for improvement in terms of consistency and interestingness.", "meta_eval_result": "<Reasoning_for_scoring_story>\nThe story is extremely brief and lacks depth, failing to establish a clear narrative or character development. The leap from seeking a second job to attending a local rally, followed by a vague mention of overpaying, does not coalesce into a coherent or engaging plot. The motivation behind the protagonist's actions and how these actions interlink is unclear, resulting in a narrative that feels disjointed and incomplete.
