The story starts off with the \"dark\" getting ready for lunch, but then it \"had to give up\" without any explanation as to why. The introduction of the roommate on the bench is also confusing, as it is unclear what the bench is referring to. The story ends with the main character putting his stuff in the toaster and going to bed, which again, lacks context and explanation.\n\nOverall, the story lacks consistency, coherence, and clarity, making it difficult to understand and appreciate the intended message or meaning.", "meta_eval_result": "<Reasoning_for_scoring_story>\nThe story seems to be an attempt at a surreal or abstract narrative, but it lacks clarity and cohesion.

It is unclear who the female is, who her son is, and what the relationship is between the female and the person she is sending a note to. There are also inconsistencies in the use of pronouns, with the female referred to as \"she\" and \"her\" but also as \"FEMALE\" in all capital letters.\n\nThe story also lacks fluency, as the sentences are not well-constructed and fail to form a logical sequence. The use of \"complained\" in the first two sentences is vague and does not provide enough context for the reader to understand the situation. Additionally, the statement that the female \"had anger issues\" is dropped into the story without any build-up or explanation.\n\nThe story does contain a hint of creativity in the form of the female sending a note instead of speaking directly to the person she is addressing. However, this is not enough to salvage the overall quality of the story.", "meta_eval_result": "<Reasoning_for_scoring_story>\nThe story seems to be a collection of disconnected phrases rather than a coherent narrative. It lacks clarity in character relationships and context, making it difficult for the reader to understand the situation. The use of \"FEMALE\" in all caps is inconsistent and confusing.
